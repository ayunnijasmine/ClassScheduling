# Introduction

The algorithms that are suitable for a non-preemptive algorithms besides FCFS algorithms are SJF and Priority Scheduling. As for FCFS scheduling algorithm known as "First Come First Serve" scheduling is the process which arrives first will be executed first. Meanwhile, in SJF (Shortest Job First) scheduling is known as the process with the shortest burst time or duration first and it is the best approach to get the small amount of waiting time. Last but not least, Priority scheduling sets its process either internally or externally where the process which is the most urgent is processed first and followed by the ones with less priority in order.

# Consideration

In this Class Scheduling Assignment, we are considering in finding the optimum class schedule algorithm. We are proposing the best scheduling algorithm to implement in finding the best Class Scheduling solution. In order to find the best Class Scheduling solution is to choose the schedule that is non preemptive scheduling algorithm to avoid interrupts in between the processes. If the interrupts occur, the class will stop running to allow another process to run. Thus, in this assignment, non-preemptive algorithms are chosen to propose the best scheduling algorithm to implement in finding the best Class Scheduling solution.
