# Introduction
The algorithms that are suitable for a non-preemptive algorithms besides FCFS algorithms are SJF and Priority Scheduling. As for FCFS scheduling algorithm known as "First Come First Serve" scheduling is the process which arrives first will be executed first. Meanwhile, in SJF (Shortest Job First) scheduling is known as the process with the shortest burst time or duration first and it is the best approach to get the small amount of waiting time. Last but not least, Priority scheduling sets its process either internally or externally where the process which is the most urgent is processed first and followed by the ones with less priority in order. However, SJF and Priority have both algorithm, which are preemptive and non preemptive but in this scheduling, non preemptive is chosen to fulfill the requirements needed for this Class Scheduling.
